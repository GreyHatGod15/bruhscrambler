# Bruhscrambler
An extremely fast (0.001s) "algorithm" to check if a word is scrambled in another word

## Use
To find scrambled words inside a scrambled word

Aka

Ex: To find the word "sussybaka" in the scrambled "ssysauakabhduqhdd"

## Idea behind logic
The algorithm instead of randomly scrambling the scrambled word,
uses the data (number of letters) and compares with the data of
the required word. Returns True of False based on result

## Performance
Not that fast though, tests took an average 0.001 seconds
You can modify and publish your version as this is MIT licensed
